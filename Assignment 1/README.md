For Assignment One, I began my HTML and CSS layout in class, and from there, explored different approaches using online resources to help me overcome a few challenges I faced. For example, I struggled with creating a flexbox and wrapping my nav items inside a flex container. I used Pixel Free Studio's blog, which provided me with framebox examples, and W3Schools' Flexbox guide, which explained flex-container usage and was linked in one of the GitHub files. Another difficulty was switching the list from vertical to horizontal. Overall, working with nav ul li a was a very tedius process, but it gave me a better understanding of which properties apply where.
