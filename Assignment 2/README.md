Having to use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I initally found it  difficult to figure out where to place each element and how to structure my code properly. I had to rely a lot on the wra420-class-examples to recall how to do certain tasks, such as centering text or creating transitions. I also used some resources from the slides, including MDN, which gave helpful examples of how to use elements like <button> and addEventListener(). There were moments when I got really stuck, especially when trying to add text outline and change the text color each time the button was clicked. After several unsuccessful attempts using online websites or reddit threads, I turned to ChatGPT to see what I might have missed or done incorrectly. It turned out that there were a few elements that needed fixing and some important pieces were missing. This process also introduced me to several unfamiliar elements, which made me revisit the MDN website to better understand their definitions and functions.
